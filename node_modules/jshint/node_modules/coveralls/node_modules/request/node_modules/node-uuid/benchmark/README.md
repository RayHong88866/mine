# node-uuid Benchmarks

### Results

To see the results of our benchmarks visit https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark

### Run them yourself

node-uuid comes with some benchmarks to measure performance of generating UUIDs. These can be run using node.js. node-uuid is being benchmarked against some other uuid modules, that are available through npm namely `uuid` and `uuid-js`.

To prepare and run the benchmark issue;

```
npm install uuid uuid-js
node benchmark/benchmark.js
```

You'll see an output like this one:

```
# v4
nodeuuid.v4(): 854700 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v4('binary'): 788643 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v4('binary', buffer): 1336898 uuids/second
uuid(): 479386 uuids/second
uuid('binary'): 582072 uuids/second
uuidjs.create(4): 312304 uuids/second

# v1
nodeuuid.v1(): 938086 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v1('binary'): 683060 uuids/second
nodeuuid.v1('binary', buffer): 1644736 uuids/second
uuidjs.create(1): 190621 uuids/second
```
