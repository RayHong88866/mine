## Important

This tool is still on early development and is missing support for many
important features.

**We are looking for [contributors](https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!!**



## Why?

[jsbeautifier.org](http://jsbeautifier.org/) doesn't have enough options and
not all IDEs/Editors have a good JavaScript code formatter. I would like to
have a command line tool (and standalone lib) as powerful/flexible as the
[WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and
[FDT](http://fdt.powerflasher.com/) code formatters.

This tool could also be reused by other node.js libs like
[escodegen](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen/) to format the output
(so each lib has a single responsibility).

For more reasoning behind it and history of the project see: [esformatter
& rocambole](http://blog.millermedeiros.com/esformatter-rocambole/)



## How?

This tool uses [rocambole](https://github.com/millermedeiros/rocambole) (based
on Esprima) to recursively parse the tokens and transform it *in place*.



## Goals

 - *granular* control about white spaces, indent and line breaks.
 - command line interface (cli).
 - be non-destructive.
 - support for local/global config file so settings ca
