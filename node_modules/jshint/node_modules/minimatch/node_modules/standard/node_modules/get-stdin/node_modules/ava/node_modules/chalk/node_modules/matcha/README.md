# Matcha

> A caffeine driven, simple approach to benchmarking.

Matcha allow you to design experiments that will measure the performance of your code. It is recommended that each
bench focus on a specific point of impact in your application.

## Installation

Matcha is available on npm.

      $ npm install matcha

## Writing Async Benchmarks

Though suites/benches are executed serially, the benches themselves can be asyncronous. Furthermore, suites ran with
the matcha command line runner have a number of globals to simplify bench definitions. Take the following code, for example:

```js
suite('Make Tea', function () {
  var tea = new CupOfTea('green');

  bench('boil water', function(next) {
    tea.boil('85â„ƒ', function (err, h20) {
      // perfect temperature!
      next();
    });
  });

  // add tea, pour, ...  

  bench('sip tea', function() {
    tea.sip('mmmm');
  });
});
```
#### Async vs. Sync

Since boiling water takes time, a `next` function was provided to each iteration in our bench to be called when the
async function completes. Since the consumption of tea provides instant gratification, no `next` needed to be provided, even though
we still wish to measure it.

#### Setup/Teardown

Arbitray functions may be specified for setup or teardown for each suite by using the `before` and `after` keywords.
These function may be sync or async.

```js
suite('DB', function() {
  before(function(next) {
    db.connect('localh
