# Espree

Espree is an actively-maintained fork Esprima, a high performance,
standard-compliant [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
parser written in ECMAScript (also popularly known as
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)).

## Features

- Full support for ECMAScript 5.1 ([ECMA-262](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm))
- Implements [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) (both ES5 and ES6 specs) as the AST format.
- Optional tracking of syntax node location (index-based and line-column)
- Heavily tested and battle-hardened by inclusion in [ESLint](http://eslint.org)

## Usage

Install:

```
npm i espree --save
```

And in your Node.js code:

```javascript
var espree = require("espree");

var ast = espree.parse(code);
```

There is a second argument to `parse()` that allows you to specify various options:

```javascript
var espree = require("espree");

var ast = espree.parse(code, {

    // attach range information to each node
    range: true,

    // attach line/column location information to each node
    loc: true,

    // create a top-level comments array containing all comments
    comments: true,

    // attach comments to the closest relevant node as leadingComments and
    // trailingComments
    attachComment: true,

    // create a top-level tokens array containing all tokens
    tokens: true,

    // try to continue parsing if an error is encountered, store errors in a
    // top-level errors array
    tolerant: true,

    // specify parsing features (default only has blockBindings: true)
    // setting this option replaces the default values
    ecmaFeatures: {

        // enable parsing of arrow functions
        arrowFunctions: true,

        // enable parsing of let/const
        blockBindings: true,

        // enable parsing of destructured arrays and objects
        destructuring: true,

        // enable parsing of regular expression y flag
        regexYFlag: true,

        // enable parsing of regular expression u flag
        regexUFlag: true,

        // enable parsing of template strings
        templateStrings: true,

        // enable parsing of binary literals
        binaryLiterals: true,

        // enable parsing of ES6 octal literals
        octalLiterals: true,

        // enable parsing unicode code point escape sequences
        unicodeCodePointEscapes: true,

        // enable parsing of default parameters
        defaultParams: true,

        // enable parsing of rest parameters
        restParams: true,

        // enable parsing of for-of statement
        forOf: true,

        // enable parsing computed object literal properties
        objectLiteralComputedProperties: true,

        // enable parsing of shorthand object literal methods
        objectLiteralShorthandMethods: true,

        // enable parsing of shorthand object literal properties
        objectLiteralShorthandProperties: true,

        // Allow duplicate object literal properties (except '__proto__')
        objectLiteralDuplicateProperties: true,

        // enable parsing of generators/yield
        generators: true,

        // enable parsing spread operator
        spread: true,

        // enable super in functions
        superInFunctions: true,

        // enable parsing classes
        classes: true,

        // enable parsing of new.target
        newTarget: false,

        // enable parsing of modules
        modules: true,

        // enable React JSX parsing
        jsx: true,

        // enable return in global scope
        globalReturn: true,

        // allow experimental object rest/spread
        experimentalObjectRestSpread: true
    }
});
```

## Plans

Espree starts as a fork of Esprima v1.2.2, the last stable published released of Esprima before work on ECMAScript 6 began. Espree's first version is therefore v1.2.2 and is 100% compatible with Esprima v1.2.2 as a drop-in replacement. The version number will be incremented based on [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) as features and bug fixes are added.

The immediate plans are:

1. Move away from giant files and move towards small, modular files that are easier to manage.
1. Move towards CommonJS for all files and use browserify to create browser bundles.
1. Support ECMAScript version filtering, allowing users to specify which version the parser should work in (similar to Acorn's `ecmaVersion` property).
1. Add tests to track comment attachment.
1. Add well-thought-out features that are useful for tools developers.
1. Add full support for ECMAScript 6.
1. Add optional parsing of JSX.

## Esprima Compatibility Going Forward

The primary goal is to produce the exact same AST structure as Esprima and Acorn, and that takes precedence over anything else. (The AST structure being the ESTree API with JSX extensions.) Separate from that, Espree may deviate from what Esprima outputs in terms of where and how comments are attached, as well as what additional information is available on AST nodes. That is to say, Espree may add more things to the AST nodes than Esprima does but the overall AST structure produced will be the same.

Espree may also deviate from Esprima in the interface it exposes.

## Frequent and Incremental Releases

Espree will not do giant releases. Releases will happen periodically as changes are made and incremental releases will be made towards larger goals. For instance, we will not have one big release for ECMAScript 6 support. Instead, we will implement ECMAScript 6, piece-by-piece, hiding those pieces behind an `ecmaFeatures` property that allows you to opt-in to use those features.

## Build Commands

* `npm test` - run all linting and tests
* `npm run lint` - run all linting
* `npm run browserify` - creates a version of Espree that is usable in a browser

## Known Incompatibilities

In an effort to help those wanting to transition from other parsers to Espree, the following is a list of noteworthy incompatibilities with other parsers. These are known differences that we do not intend to change.

### Esprima 1.2.2

* None.

### Esprima/Harmony Branch

* Esprima/Harmony uses a different comment attachment algorithm
